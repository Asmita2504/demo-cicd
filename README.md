1. Completed Parts:

CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions.

Configured workflow for code checkout, Maven build, and packaging.

Created Dockerfile for containerization.

Pipeline builds and tags Docker image locally.


2. Pending / Not Fully Executed

Docker push to repository: Encountered authentication/permissions issues while pushing images.

AWS EC2 deployment: Could not complete due to setup/connection challenges.


3.Efforts Taken

Generated and tested SSH key pairs for secure connections.

Tried multiple fixes for Docker push authentication errors.

Explored EC2 instance setup and deployment configurations.

Re-ran builds and debugging steps multiple times to identify root cause.


(If More Time Is Given)

Resolve Docker Hub / AWS ECR authentication for smooth image push.

Configure EC2 instance properly for deployment and test successful pipeline run.

Add automated test execution inside the CI pipeline.
